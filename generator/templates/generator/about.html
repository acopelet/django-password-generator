    <h2>What is a random password generator?</h2>
    <p>A random password generator is a tool that frees <br>
        you from having to constantly come up with unique <br>passwords for each of your sites. 
        It works by automatically generating strong and random<br> passwords that include
        combinations of numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters, <br>and special characters.
        These combinations can be adjusted to fit different sites' <br>unique password requirements.</p>
